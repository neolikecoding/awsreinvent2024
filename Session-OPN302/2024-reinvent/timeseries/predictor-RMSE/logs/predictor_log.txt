Inferred time series frequency: 'W-MON'
Provided train_data has 8613 rows (NaN fraction=6.8%), 319 time series. Median time series length is 27 (min=27, max=27). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'unit_sales'
	known_covariates:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['scaled_price', 'promotion_email', 'promotion_homepage']
	static_features:
		categorical:        ['product_code', 'product_category', 'location_code']
		continuous (float): []

AutoGluon will ignore following non-numeric/non-informative columns:
	ignored static_features: ['product_subcategory']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
