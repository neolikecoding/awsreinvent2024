Chronos models are pretrained on a large collection of real & synthetic time series data, which enables them to make accurate forecasts on new data out of the box.\n",

    "\n",
    "Being a pretrained model for zero-shot forecasting, Chronos is different from other models available in AG-TS. \n",
    "Specifically, Chronos models do not really `fit` time series data. However, when `predict` is called, they carry out a relatively more expensive computation that scales linearly with the number of time series in the dataset. In this aspect, they behave like local statistical models such as ETS or ARIMA, where all computation happens during inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGluon supports both the original Chronos models (e.g., [`chronos-t5-large`](https://huggingface.co/autogluon/chronos-t5-large)), as well as the new, more accurate and up to 250x faster Chronos-Bolt⚡ models (e.g., [`chronos-bolt-base`](https://huggingface.co/autogluon/chronos-bolt-base)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get started with Chronos is through the model-specific presets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **(recommended)** The new, fast Chronos-Bolt️ models can be accessed using the `\"bolt_tiny\"`, `\"bolt_mini\"`, `\"bolt_small\"` and `\"bolt_base\"` presets.\n",

    "Note that the original Chronos models of size `small` and above require a GPU to run, while all Chronos-Bolt models can be run both on a CPU and a GPU.\n",

    "Alternatively, Chronos can be combined with other time series models using presets `\"medium_quality\"`, `\"high_quality\"` and `\"best_quality\"`. More details about these presets are available in the documentation for [`TimeSeriesPredictor.fit`](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/api/autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.fit.html)."
