The data used for validation is separated from the training data and is used to determine the models and hyperparameter-values that produce the best results. Rather than just a single model, AutoGluon trains multiple models and ensembles them together to obtain superior predictive performance.\n",

    "By default, AutoGluon tries to fit [various types of models](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/api/autogluon.tabular.models.html) including neural networks and tree ensembles.

This involves repeatedly training models under different hyperparameter settings and evaluating their performance. This process can be computationally-intensive, so `fit()` parallelizes this process across multiple threads using [Ray](https://www.ray.io/). To control runtimes, you can specify various arguments in `fit()` such as `time_limit` as demonstrated in the subsequent **[In-Depth Tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular/tabular-indepth.html)**."

The default value of `presets` is `'medium_quality'`, which produces _less_ accurate models but facilitates faster prototyping. With `presets`, you can flexibly prioritize predictive accuracy vs. training/inference speed. For example, if you care less about predictive performance and want to quickly deploy a basic model, consider using: `presets=['good_quality', 'optimize_for_deployment']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide the parameter `eval_metric` to `TabularPredictor()` if you know what metric will be used to evaluate predictions in your application. Some other non-default metrics you might use include things like: `'f1'` (for binary classification), `'roc_auc'` (for binary classification), `'log_loss'` (for classification), `'mean_absolute_error'` (for regression), `'median_absolute_error'` (for regression). You can also define your own custom metric function. For more information refer to [Adding a custom metric to AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular/advanced/tabular-custom-metric.html).\n",

    "- Include all your data in `train_data` and do not provide `tuning_data` (AutoGluon will split the data more intelligently to fit its needs).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not specify the `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs` argument (counterintuitively, hyperparameter tuning is not the best way to spend a limited training time budgets, as model ensembling is often superior). We recommend you only use `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs` if your goal is to deploy a single model rather than an ensemble.\n",

    "- Do not specify the `hyperparameters` argument (allow AutoGluon to adaptively select which models/hyperparameters to use).\n",

    "- Set `time_limit` to the longest amount of time (in seconds) that you are willing to wait. AutoGluon's predictive performance improves the longer `fit()` is allowed to run.\n",

To specify a particular evaluation metric other than the default, set the `eval_metric` parameter of [TabularPredictor()](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/api/autogluon.tabular.TabularPredictor.html) and AutoGluon will tailor its models to optimize your metric (e.g. `eval_metric = 'mean_absolute_error'`). For evaluation metrics where higher values are worse (like RMSE), AutoGluon will flip their sign and print them as negative values during training (as it internally assumes higher values are better). You can even specify a custom metric by following the [Custom Metric Tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular/advanced/tabular-custom-metric.html).\n",
